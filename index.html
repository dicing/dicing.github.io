	<h2>How it works?</h2>

	<img class="formula" src="formula.svg"> </a>

<p>basically its some sort of gambling in Runescape 3. clicking the above image will take you into the wiki's damage maths. that way you can check by yourself if its fair or no. </p>

<p>Allright, with that said: ill be using a Abyssal whip to damage you in a Duel. the number that it outputs will be your Roll. simple as that.</p>

<p>Defence is completly irrelevant for our mathematics, so we are just taking care about Strength and Attack,and we will be using the STOMP skill, becuase it have a fix amount of damage (40%-200%). but you must be 99 to play; because that way we can have more precise mathematics and have sure that nobody is losing to the odds.</p>

<p>We are always going to be with the highest rolls, cause that way things that increase your combat as stat potions will be useless.</p>
